# [Library for AIU]

## Author: Natalia Klimareva, Fatima Bekmamatova COM19-A

Each university has its own library. Unfortunately, there are not enough books for all students.In order for the librarian to see exactly how many books are left, we have created an app where he can add books, edit their number, link the book to the student and see the date when the student must turn in the book.

## There is the first and main window: 

Here we can see the list of all books, with it's amount. There are 4 buttons on the bottom, and the search box on the top.

When we put the book name, author name or amounts of the book, the appropriate raws are stay, and the unwanted raws are disappear:

By clicking on the button named "Add Book" we move to a new window, where we can fill all the text fields and add the book to a database. To save it, we need to click "Apply"

Now we return to the main window and click "Refresh", after we can see a new row with added book:

After refreshing, the connection between the student and the table is added on the database:

When we move to the main window and refresh it, we can see, that left amount is decreased by one:
