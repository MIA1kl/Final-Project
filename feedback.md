### "Before starting, I would like to point out how cool the idea is! First of all, it is a very convenient "tool" for the whole university, both for professors and students, because it saves time and nerves from paperwork. Secondly, I liked this project because it fits perfectly into the current age of technology. In particular, we young people are used to everything happening at the touch of a finger and to having technology in front of us, not paper. So I saw only pluses, and it would be cool if this project would be implemented in the future. Fatima Bakmamatova and Natalia Klimarenko from COM19 did a great job!  I'm proud of my seniors!"
